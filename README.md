# The Splunk Software Development Kit for Java

This README is a work in progress.

## Requirements

Java 1.6 or higher.

## Getting started

### Building

In order to build the SDK, simply type the following from the root of the 
repository.

    ant

In order to remove all build artifacts from the repository simply type:

    ant clean

Take a look at `build.xml` for additional other targets if you are interested
in more control of the build process.

You can also type `ant {target} -find` from anywhere in the repository and ant
will automatically find the root build file.
